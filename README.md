[http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/](http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/)

Requirements
--------

SilverStripe 3

Instalation
--------

```bash
composer require sheadawson/silverstripe-timepickerfield
```

Usage
--------

```php
TimePickerField::create('Time');
```

You can set any of the [http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/#usage](configurations) by using:

```php
TimePickerField::create('Time')->setTimePickerConfig($key, $value);
```
If you need to modify an existing DatetimeField, you can set the time field to a picker by using:

```php
$field = DatetimeField::create('DateAndTime');
$field->setTimeField(TimePickerField::create('DateAndTime'));
```

Or if you like you can also use the following to create a DateTimePickerField from scratch:

```php
$field = DatetimePickerField::create('DateAndTime');
```
